# EV_Load_Predictor


# ðŸ”‹ EV Charging Load Predictor

This is a machine learning-powered web app that predicts the **EV Charging Station Load (in kWh)** based on input factors like time, weather, traffic, and more.

Built using **Streamlit**, it allows easy, real-time predictions through a simple web interface.
